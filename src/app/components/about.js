//             My name is Roger, and my journey has been marked by resilience and
//             determination. I began my pursuit of higher education with dreams of
//             academic success, but financial constraints led me to make a
//             difficult decision. Unable to afford university fees in the
//             Democratic Republic of Congo, I sought refuge in South Africa,
//             particularly in the vibrant city of Cape Town. My initial purpose in
//             fleeing to South Africa was to find a way to finance my university
//             education and eventually complete my degree. However, fate had
//             different plans for me. Despite my best efforts, I found myself
//             unable to secure the necessary funds to pursue my academic
//             aspirations. In the midst of uncertainty, I turned to painting as a
//             means of survival. For four years, I poured my heart and soul into
//             my artwork, using it as a means to support myself financially. Yet,
//             amidst the strokes of my brush and the vibrant colors on canvas,
//             there was always a yearning for something moreâ€”a desire to break
//             free from the constraints of my circumstances and forge a brighter
//             future. During those years as a painter, I never lost sight of my
//             ultimate goal. In the pockets of time between brushstrokes and
//             commissions, I dedicated myself to self-teaching coding. With
//             determination as my compass, I delved into the world of programming,
//             learning new languages and techniques with each passing day. Though
//             the journey was challenging and the road fraught with obstacles, I
//             persevered. With each line of code I wrote, I felt myself inching
//             closer to a future filled with promise and opportunity. And as I
//             honed my skills, I began to see glimpses of the transformation I had
//             been striving for. Today, as a self-taught web developer, I stand as
//             a testament to the power of perseverance and the resilience of the
//             human spirit. My journey from university dropout to coding
//             enthusiast has been marked by trials and triumphs, but through it
//             all, I have remained steadfast in my pursuit of a better tomorrow.
//             And as I continue to chart my course in the ever-evolving world of
//             technology, I am reminded that with dedication and determination,
//             anything is possible.
